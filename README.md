My ambitions to build a WorldLeaders webpage

Similar interface to Wordle 

Use the wikiepedia table: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_heads_of_state_and_government
to get names, country. Go into each leaders page to get the picture to visulise 
Can I screen this site daily to create a new base of data? Or should I just load the wiki url? 

Clues can either be guessed by name or by country 
You have to guess correct on both???
